# smallR
 A lightweight docker image for R

## r-hub/minimal-r
If you need truly minimal images (sub 100MB), see [r-hub/r-minimal](https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal)
However, be cautioned that these images do not have many dependencies, so they won't support nearly any graphics or source that needs to be compiled natively. They are also built on alpine-linux, which is bit more difficult to install dependencies than a debian distribution.

## Current Image Sizes

- spatial
`1.33GB`
